## Customization

### Changing Links

Edit the `index.html` file to update your social media links:

```html
<a href="https://your-instagram.com" class="link-button instagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <span class="link-text">Instagram</span>
</a>
```

### Adding Your Profile Picture

Your logo is already integrated! The website uses your custom "F" logo with the vibrant green circle and neon glow effect. If you want to update the logo:

1. Replace the `logo.png` file in the project folder with your new logo
2. Make sure the image is square and high quality (recommended: 240x240px or larger)
3. The logo will automatically be styled with the circular frame and hover effects

### Customizing the Logo Display

If you want to modify how your logo appears, you can edit the CSS for `.profile-logo` in `styles.css`:

```css
.profile-logo {
    width: 120px;          /* Change size here */
    height: 120px;
    border-radius: 50%;     /* Remove for square logo */
    /* ... other styles ... */
}
```

### Modifying Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css` to change the color scheme:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #5ffe10;
    --secondary-color: #105b06;
}
```
